# RecipeApp
This app showcases my ability to use React, specifically the useState() hook and multiple components.
Using my knowledge of these items in React I was able to succesfully make an app that allows a user
to add a recipe to the app and have it displayed alongside other recipes in a convenient table format.
Along with this, a user can delete recipes they no longer want displayed on the app. The app also 
includes additional styling that creates a more readable table of recipes.
